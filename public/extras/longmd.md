# Section 2: Structure & Project Set-up

## Characteristics of EDM

### Tempo
BPM stays the same throughout the piece (set and forget!)

### Subdivisions
- Four on the floor
    - Kick drum is steady and uniform
    - Falls on all four beats of the bar
    - Most common 
- Breakbeat
    - Non-uniform
    - Falls before, or after the four beats of a bar

### Time Signature
    - 4/4 time
    - Most common, most simple, easy to mix into other EDM

___
## EDM Structure (Part 1)

### Intro
    - Serves no purpose, except for DJs to mix other music into our track.
    - Typically 8 to 24 bars long.
    - Hint at main elements of your track.
    - Builds into the breakdown (adds more elements gradually)

### Breakdown
    - Tension from intro is relieved
    - Energy is at lowest
    - Has very little to no drums
    - Typically 8 to 32 bars long
    - Introduces main chord pattern

### Buildup
    - Most important (no overdo or underdo)
    - Telling listeners that something is coming
    - Builds tension
    - Typically 8 to 16 long (16 bars being quite long)

### Drop
    - Releases all tention
    - Much more louder and more full
    - Typically 24 bars long, with final 8 bars introducing something new
    - Sounds like a more intense version of the breakdown

### Second Breakdown
    - More developed version of the first brekdown
    - Carries more energy than the first
    - Can also introce something new, such as new melody or instrument, but must return to the original idea of the track

### Second Buildup
    - Almost identical to the first buildup
    - Can also be longer than the first, creating extra suspense
    - Can add extra elements, but not overdo it

### Second Drop
    - You can copy and paste the first drop, but it will be less interesting
    - Add something new, such as new instruments, alter the melody slightly, or drums.

### Outro
    - For DJ to mix into other tracks
    - Slowly decreasing elements in the track
    - Typically from 8 to 24 bars long


___
## EDM Structure (Part 2)
No structure is set in stone, you can play around with it.

### Standard
    - The structure above
    - Most solid and common

### Delayed Breakdown
    - First breakdown comes after the drop
    - Intro -> Build up -> Drop -> Breakdown

### No Breakdown
    - Intro -> Build up -> Drop -> Development Intro -> Drop

### Binary Phrasing
Something happenes every eight bars, it can be minor change, such as addition of a new drum, so the track progresses well.

### Call & Response (Antiphony)
    - Used with instruments
    - Can also be used with vocals

### Energy
    - Building and releasing it as the track progresses
    - Teasing the listener is important

___
# Section 3: Building Drums

## Main Elements of EDM Drums

### Kick Drum
    - The base of all beats
    - Every beat of the bar

### Clap / Snare
    - Clap is more common in EDM
    - Usually played on the second and the fourth beat of the bar

### Prominent Offbeat Hat
    - Always go on the third step of the beat, or inbetween excatly two beats
    - Very important, definately include it

### Meter Hat
    - Plays on all four beats of the bar

### Background Shaker
    - Shaking effect, may apply swing

### Filler hat
    - Extra hi hats used for rhythmic effects
    - Not necessary, but makes your drum sound more professional

### Rhythmic Percussion
    - Optional
    - If used with swing, adds groove to the track

### Pitched Percussion
    - If you can hum the same note as the percussion, it will be pitched
    - Bongos, Cowbells


___
## Finding Suitable Drum Samples
Try to layer your drums in your track, makes your drum pattern sound more full and professional.

### Kicks
Do not layer your kick, unless you know what you are doing.

### Claps
When you layer your clap, try to look for a short clap and a long clap. A short clap is transient, meaning sharp and snappy. When layering your clap, you can also try to layer it with a percussion

### Hi Hats
Similar with the claps, you need to find a closed(short) hat and an open(long) hat
For meter hat and filler hat, use short hats because if you use a long hat, it will overlap other samples, and it will sound messy.

### Shaker
Use it to fill up space of the drum pattern. You can use a hi hat, but if it too clicky, you might distract the listener. Look for short one, so it does not overlap other samples.

### Percussion
Two types: rhythm percussion and pitched percussion. The precussion sample should be short. The shorter the sample, the more groove that the pattern will have.
